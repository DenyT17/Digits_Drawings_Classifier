## Description ‚ùî‚ùì
In this project I will learn how to build DIGITS DRAWINGS CLASSIFIER. To this purpose I will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Tkinter. 

First I will build basicly GUI using Tkinter. It will be developed with new functionalities.

Using TensorFlow I will try to train model with the best possible classifying accuracy.


I will regularly share the results of my work.


## What am I going to learn from this project üîù 

- Creating GUI with Tkinter
- Image classification with TensorFlow
- How to building Sequential model
- How to prepare images dataset before training 


## DatasetüìÅ

To train my model I will use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayavariabdi/didadataset?select=250000) dataset.

## The current result of the work üîç
At this moment to classifing drawing digits, I use model training on MNIST dataset. In future I will want change this model to one with better accuracy. 
Currently, the GUI has functionalities such as:

* classification of figures drawings in real time,
* performing simple mathematical operations on recognized numbers
